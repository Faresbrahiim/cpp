# Math Skills Project

## Author

## Description

This project is a C++ program that performs various mathematical calculations on a dataset. It reads data from a file (`data.txt`), calculates the average, median, variance, and standard deviation, and displays the results.

The program is designed to handle floating-point numbers and provides accurate results for statistical analysis.

## Features

- **Average**: Calculates the mean of the dataset.
- **Median**: Finds the middle value of the dataset.
- **Variance**: Measures the spread of the dataset.
- **Standard Deviation**: Represents the amount of variation in the dataset.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).
- **Input File**: A file named `data.txt` containing one number per line.

## How to Run the Program

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you have the project in a repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
# Replace <repository_url> with the actual repository URL
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

### Step 2: Compile the Program

Compile the program using `g++`:

```bash
g++ main.cpp externalFunctions/calcule.cpp -o math-skills
```

### Step 3: Run the Program

Execute the compiled program:

```bash
./myprogram
```

Make sure the `data.txt` file is in the same directory as the program before running it.

### Step 4: Run the Script

If you downloaded the script `mathskills` directly, ensure it is executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x mathskills
```

Then execute the script using:

```bash
./mathskills
```
